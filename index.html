	<h1><i class="em em-wave"></i> Hi! I'm Ngan.</h1>
	<p>Just in case you're wondering, it's pronounced naan, like the bread. I'm a designer who loves code, puns and donuts.</p>

	<p>I'm currently taking on freelance art &amp; design projects with various clients. My most recent contract was with <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, creating promotional and interactive display ads for their <a href="https://wordpress.com/create/">WordPress</a> brand redesign.</p>
		
	<p>Previously, I led the design efforts for <a href="https://prefect.io">Prefect</a>'s Cloud application and user interface in my role as Principal/Lead Product Designer. My responsibilities mainly consisted of planning and conducting usability research tests, building useful and accessible user experiences through strategic content creation and thoughtful information architecture, developing and maintaining a consistent design system and style guide, and producing data visualizations. Before that, I was a Senior UI/UX Designer at <a href="https://newtarget.com">New Target</a> and a Senior Front-End Designer on the Revenue Ad Products & Branded Content Team at <a href="https://voxmedia.com">Vox Media</a>.</p>
		
	<!--
	Vox Media: leading design and helped build products &amp; platforms that tell powerful and engaging stories both on- and off-platform for our brand partners.</p>
	
	New target: where I led the design team to create quality custom web solutions for associations, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and commercial businesses and corporations. 
-->

	<p>In 2016, I was selected as one of 28 women out of over 400 applicants to attend the <a href="http://www.poynter.org/2016/introducing-the-2016-ona-poynter-leadership-academy-for-women-in-digital-media/399585/"  >ONA-Poynter Leadership Academy for Women in Digital Media</a>. DCFemTech also named me one of DC's Most Powerful Women Designers in <a href="http://tech.co/second-annual-dcfemtech-awards-2016-04">2016</a> and <a href="https://dcfemtech.github.io/awards-2017-media">2017</a>.</p>

	<p>I graduated Magna Cum Laude from <a href="https://soa.gmu.edu/"  >George Mason University</a> in 2012 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Art &amp; Visual Technology and a concentration in Graphic Design.</p>

	<p>In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking, traveling and making puns.
