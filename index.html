		<h1><i class="em em-wave"></i> Hi! I'm Ngan.</h1>
		<p>Just in case you're wondering, it's pronounced naan, like the bread. I'm a designer who loves code, puns and donuts.</p>

		<p>Currently, I'm freelancing with <a href="https://automattic.com">Automattic</a>, creating display ads for their WordPress brand redesign. Previously, I was a Senior UI/UX Designer at <a href="https://newtarget.com">New Target</a>, leading the design team to create quality custom web solutions for associations, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and commercial businesses and corporations. Before that, I was at <a href="https://voxmedia.com">Vox Media</a> working on the Branded Content Lab Team as a Senior Front-End Designer. There, I led design and helped build products &amp; platforms that tell powerful and engaging stories both on- and off-platform for our brand partners.</p>

		<p>In 2016, I was selected as one of 28 women out of over 400 applicants to attend the <a href="http://www.poynter.org/2016/introducing-the-2016-ona-poynter-leadership-academy-for-women-in-digital-media/399585/"  >ONA-Poynter Leadership Academy for Women in Digital Media</a>. DCFemTech also named me one of DC's Most Powerful Women Designers in <a href="http://tech.co/second-annual-dcfemtech-awards-2016-04"  >2016</a> and <a href="https://dcfemtech.github.io/awards-2017-media"  >2017</a>.</p>

		<p>I graduated Magna Cum Laude from <a href="https://soa.gmu.edu/"  >George Mason University</a> in 2012 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Art &amp; Visual Technology and a concentration in Graphic Design.</p>

		<p>In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking, traveling and making puns. You can e-mail me at <a href="mailto:hello@ngansensical.design">hello@ngansensical.design</a> or find me on social media: <a href="https://github.com/itsngansense" >github</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/itsngansense" >twitter</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/itsngansense">instagram</a>, <a href="https://dribbble.com/itsngansense">dribbble</a>.</p>
