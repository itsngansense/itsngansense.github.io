	<p>Hi! I'm Ngan, pronounced naan, like the bread. I'm a designer who loves code and I make things on the interwebs.</p>

	<p>Currently, I'm at <a href="http://voxmedia.com" target="_blank">Vox Media</a> working on the Branded Content Lab Team, leading design and helping build products &amp; platforms that tell powerful and engaging stories both on- and off-platform for our brand partners.</p>

	<p>In 2016, I was selected as one of 28 women out of over 400 applicants to attend the <a href="http://www.poynter.org/2016/introducing-the-2016-ona-poynter-leadership-academy-for-women-in-digital-media/399585/" target="_blank">ONA-Poynter Leadership Academy for Women in Digital Media</a>. DCFemTech also named me <a href="http://tech.co/second-annual-dcfemtech-awards-2016-04" target="_blank">one of DC's Most Powerful Women Designers</a>.</p>

	<p>I graduated from <a href="https://soa.gmu.edu/" target="_blank">George Mason University</a> in 2012 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Art &amp; Visual Technology and a concentration in Graphic Design. In 2014, I decided I wanted to learn how to code and develop my programming skills! I took General Assembly's 10 week part-time course in Front End Web Development and upon completion, I continued to utilize my newly acquired expertise and after some time, transitioned into a front-end designer position at Vox Media.</p>

	<p>In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking, traveling and making puns. You can e-mail me at <a href="mailto:knhoang13@gmail.com">knhoang13@gmail.com</a> or find me on <a href="https://github.com/ngansense" target="_blank">github</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ngansenseee" target="_blank">twitter</a>, and/or <a href="https://instagram.com/ngansenseee" target="_blank">instagram</a>.</p>
