  <h1>Hymnal Publishing Platform</h1>
  <p><strong>Role: Design &amp; Development</strong></p>
  <p>Before working on the Ad Platforms team, I was an avid user of Vox Media's proprietary custom display and native ad unit publishing platform, Hymnal as a developer on the Revenue Executions Team. That gave me an advantage when I started designing and developing for Hymnal and could really speak for its users and their day to day process. On the Ad Platforms team, I was involved in a number of design sprints to create intuitive features and push the platform forward. My team members and I worked to develop a re-usable pattern library as well. My responsibilities ranged from brainstorming, sketching, wireframing, conducting user testing, prototyping all the way through execution.
